# The Art Of... Chapter 1 notes

## CIA Triad
* C - Confidentiality
    * Information that should be kept secret remains secret
* I - Integrity
    * Information that shouldn't be changed isn't changed
* A - Availability
    * Information that should be available is available

* These form the fundamentals of security in our world

## Auditing
* Auditing an application is the process of analyzing application code (in source or binary form) to uncover vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.

### Different Types of Auditing
* In-house prerelease
    * Identify flaws before the software ever reaches the public
* In-house postrelease
    * Identify flaws that users have come across before bad actors can abuuse them
* Third party product range comparison
    * An objective third party compares the security of similar products
* Third party evaluation
    * An objective third party goes through and test an application for security
* Third part preliminary evaluation
    * A third part performs an independent review of a product before it goes to market
* Independent research
    * A security company or consulting firmr performs a software audit independently

## Black box testing
* Black box testing is a method of evaluating a software system by manipulating only its exposed interfaces.

* Differs from auditing because black box testing can **ONLY** interact with exposed interfaces, and cannot do things with internal code.
